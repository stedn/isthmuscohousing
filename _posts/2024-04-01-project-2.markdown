description: The Organizational Structuring Committee of Isthmus Cohousing is diligently focused on fortifying our foundation and ensuring the smooth operation of our community. With a steadfast commitment to transparency and inclusivity, we are actively working to adopt a formal decision-making process that empowers every member to have a voice in shaping our collective future. In parallel, we are in the process of creating essential founding documents and officially incorporating as a legal entity, laying the groundwork for a solid organizational framework. Additionally, we are crafting comprehensive values statements, policies, and membership procedures that reflect our shared ethos and guide our actions. As we move forward, we recognize the importance of establishing a system for equitable division of labor among residents and implementing means of accountability to uphold our shared responsibilities and promote a thriving, harmonious community for all.
