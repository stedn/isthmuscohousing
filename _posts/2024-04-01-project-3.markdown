description: Outreach and Recruiting Committee is in charge of spreading awareness of our new group to grow the membership and foster connections within our vibrant community. We plan engaging events, including potlucks, BBQs, and game nights, where we can create opportunities for interested folks  to come together, share experiences, and explore the joys of cohousing life. We distribute newsletters and flyers to neighborhoods, and table at Madison events. We explore avenues for media coverage, do social media outreach, and leveraging cohousing listservs to connect with like-minded individuals eager to join our community.
